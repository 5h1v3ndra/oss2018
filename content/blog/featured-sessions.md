### Collaboration between Developers, Security professionals, Application Security experts and GDPR professionals.

If you are passionate about Application Security and want to collaborate with the key players in this industry, this is the event to be. Every thoroughly prepared working session is geared towards a specific security challenges and will be focused on actionable outcomes.

- The summit brings together international experienced professionals

- Collaborations in working sessions to tackle some of the hardest security problems we are facing in 2018 and create actionable solutions.

- Connect with like-minded individuals who are passionate about AppSec and who are looking at new techniques and tools.

- Get chatting over breakfasts, lunches or dinners and during summit activities.

- Numerous CISO and CISO to be are attending the Summit. Several sessions are on Data protection officer DPO now in high demands, job opportunities are around.

- Take advantage of the unique summit venue at Woburn Forest CenterParcs, an environment designed for maximum geek-time, synergies and collaboration.

### The 2018 open Security Summit will work on

- **Automation of MASVS with BDD** - The Mobile Application Security Verification Standard (MASVS) is becoming an accepted industry best practice for mobile apps. The Open Security Summit work will extend the existing test cases for iOS and Android and transform the MASVS requirements into Gherkin Syntax.

- **Creating a standard for GDPR patterns**, with reusable mappings of data journeys across specific threat modelling scenarios. Have a standardised data model, covering all steps to security and privacy capabilities required, so the model can then be applied and tailored to each organisation and their particular capabilities and risk appetite.

- **Security Ethics Checklistset** of questions that any engineer would find useful. Create a cheat sheet of maximum 5 points, each one starting with “do” or “don’t”.

- **Work on different ways of implementing treat models in agile organisations** - Many are struggling to fit threat modelling to their agile way of working. SCRUM and Kanban processes and show where threat model blocks can fit.
Master degree in application security - A mapping of OWASP Projects against learning objectives which helps to develop a strategy for the OWASP community to support AppSec curricula. Application Security Skills and knowledge which would be required for a MSc curriculum and determining suitable learning objectives to be able to produce an “open” curriculum for any educational institution or trainer to use.
A second and larger part of the work is then to map the knowledge, skills & learning objectives to OWASP Project materials to help deliver quality educational experiences to those study Application Security.

- **OWASP Defect Dojo** - DefectDojo is a tracking tool written in Python / Django. The working session aims to discuss and add new features to Defect Dojo. It is an open source vulnerability management tool that streamlines the testing process by offering templating, report generation, metrics, and baseline self-service tools.
    -	Add Scan Integration 2.0, which is focused on shifting our integration with uploads to APIs Test new API v2 to cover all use cases
    -	Add the ability for Dojo to check for and apply updates.

- **OWASP Testing Guide v5** - The OWASP Testing Guide is being adopted as a standard for performing Application Penetration Testing.
At a “low level” Penetration Testing guide describing tools & techniques used for testing the most common application security vulnerabilities. All sections in v4 reviewed Project aligned with the ASVS and OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities:
  -	A more readable guide created that eliminates sections that are not useful
  -	New testing techniques inserted
  -	New section created: Client side security and Firefox extensions testing.

- **A key element of DevOps, the securing of the CI Pipeline** - Doing CI builds, testing, and deployments have many advantages when done correctly. Using libraries from 3rd parties in your build can be on compromised servers. Even signing your packages or artifacts automatically could result in you delivering compromised software to others.At the end we will publish:
  -	A set of practices for DevOps and Developers
  -	Cheat sheet for developers who use third party services
  -	Recommendations for 3rd party service providers

- **Attack chains as Treat Model techniques** - The Open Security Summit is the opportunity to discover threats against a system that complement the traditional threats when they do not work. Create attack chains as TM techniques with the use of DFD as connection maps, layered defence and attack patterns.
